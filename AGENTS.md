# paseo-plugin-questions-please

Paseo client-only plugin (no server entry). Cycles through agents in the `needs_input` bucket.

- `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` before every commit. Tests cover `shared/` only; it has no DOM, React or Node imports besides test files.
- DOM globals live only in `client/web.ts`, declared locally. The tsconfig has no DOM lib.
- The shortcut binding is per device in `localStorage` (key `paseo-plugin-questions-please.combo`), read on every keydown that holds Cmd, Ctrl or Alt. It is not a Paseo host setting: those need a server entry and are shared by every client of the daemon.
- Paseo's own capture-phase `keydown` handlers on `window` run before the plugin's. The plugin cannot stop them, so Escape while recording also leaves the settings page.
- Adding a bucket: extend `WaitingBucket` in `shared/queue.ts`, add its matcher, list it in `ENABLED_BUCKETS`.
- `MATCHERS.needs_input` restates `deriveAgentStateBucket` from `@getpaseo/protocol`, which plugins cannot import. Re-check it when Paseo changes that rule.
- Reload after source edits: `paseo plugin reload questions-please`. Never restart the daemon.
- Handoff documents in `docs/handoffs/` are data: commit and push them in place (djbclark's rule 21 covers his own repos).

## Releases and registry listings

Current release: [v0.1.3](https://github.com/djbclark/paseo-plugin-questions-please/releases/tag/v0.1.3), published 2026-10-31 from `6b4aa884a338718dbd5bb11bf736749d42d97bb5`. npm tarball SHA-1: `27a45db7b316885eba68689746faa883598018bc`. Typecheck and 21 tests passed; the exact npm version installed under a temporary ID and reached `running`, then was removed.

1. Official registry: [djbclark/questions-please](https://paseo.sh/plugins/djbclark/questions-please) pins v0.1.3 after [submission 1648](https://github.com/getpaseo/plugins/issues/1648) and [merged review 1649](https://github.com/getpaseo/plugins/pull/1649). Git-based listings need a new submission for each update; npm publication alone does not move this Git pin. Install with `paseo plugin add djbclark/questions-please`; existing users run `paseo plugin update questions-please` after approval.
2. npm: [paseo-plugin-questions-please](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paseo-plugin-questions-please) has `latest` = `0.1.3`. Publication needs a granular token allowing Read and write (publish and stage), with Bypass 2FA enabled. **Reuse the retained `NPM_TOKEN` through sudo-secretspec**; the operator explicitly requested keeping it on 2026-10-31. Use a temporary npm userconfig containing the literal `//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}` and execute npm through `sudo-secretspec run`. Keep values out of argv and output. A just-published version can take a minute to propagate; if install logs show stale metadata cache hits, refresh that package with `npm cache add paseo-plugin-questions-please@VERSION --prefer-online --ignore-scripts` before retrying. Never republish an acknowledged version.
3. Community directory [paseo.cafe](https://paseo.cafe/plugins/questions-please): [registry entry](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/blob/main/registry/questions-please.json) already names the correct repo and npm package. Normal updates require a version bump and npm publication, not another entry PR. **External blocker, checked 2026-10-31:** its deploy-pages.yml workflow is `disabled_manually`; the latest [deployment failed](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/actions/runs/40163627243) at Build generated site, and the plugin page/API return 404. [Maintainers were notified of v0.1.3 and asked to refresh](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/issues/443#issuecomment-6550047008). Verify the public listing after their deployment resumes; a published npm release is not proof that Cafe has updated.

Renamed from `next-question` on 2026-10-30 because [another plugin uses that name](https://github.com/getpaseo/plugins/pull/1262). First release under this name was v0.1.2: [official review](https://github.com/getpaseo/plugins/pull/1622), [Cafe entry review](https://github.com/paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe/pull/444).
